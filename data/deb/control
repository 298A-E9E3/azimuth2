Description: A spaceship metroidvania.
 Azimuth is a metroidvania-style game -- you explore, fight enemies, solve
 puzzles, find new upgrades and weapons, and uncover the storyline piece by
 piece.  Unlike many games in the genre, it's not a platformer; instead, you
 pilot a spaceship with Astroids-style controls.  There is a huge game world to
 explore, lots of little puzzles to solve, dozens of weapons and upgrades to
 find and use, and a wide variety of enemies and bosses to tangle with.
