  The iridescent forms you are referring to are

  $GNonlinear Paradimensional Shear$W.  The NPS
  catalysis engines you've been seeing are able to
  temporarily weaken the barrier between universes
  in a controlled way; the Zenith researchers were
  carefully investigating this effect.  But with
  the NPS engines now out of control, the Oth have
  been coming through freely."
!T109"
  \"Can't we just turn these NPS engines $/off$|?\""
!T110"
  Inadvisable.  With the NPS engines running
  undriven, and the data net so badly damaged,
  there is $Rno safe way$W for you to shut them down.
  Attempting to do so without the expertise of the
  researchers here could have unpredictable
  effects on the local spacial fabric, up to and
  including the destruction of the entire colony."
!T111"
  \"Yikes.  I can't risk the safety of the
  surviving colonists.  Sounds like the only way
  to save them from the Oth is for me to find them
  before the Oth do.\""
