  now?  Why aren't they just auto-regulated?\""
!T176"
  According to the lab notes I can access from
  here, the NPS effect was apparently $Yincredibly
  unstable$W, and keeping them in tune was more an
  art than a science, requiring the close study
  and undivided attention of an experienced
  operator.  The researchers struggled and mostly
  failed to find an automated solution."
!T177"
  Unfortunately, for some still-undetermined
  reason, staring into these portals for hours at
  a time tended to drive the operators mad--Humans
  and Trichords alike.  Safer procedures were put
  in place, but incidents of halluciation,
  psycosis, and sudden violent outbursts among
  those who had spent time with the NPS devices
  continued to mount."
!T178"
  Eventually, it was decided that the machines
  were too dangerous to be operated by the Human
  or Trichord researchers, so they instructed
  Azimuth to directly operate all of the NPS
  engines himself."
!T179"
  \"Right.  Earlier, the other Fragment AI told me
  that 'the central colony computer' was told to
  stabilize the NPS devices.  So that was
  Azimuth?\""
!T180"
  Correct.  Unfortunately, even the SapiAI was no
  more immune to the mind-twisting effects of the
  NPS portals than his Human and Trichord
  collegues.  Apparently, his efforts to keep the
  engines stable shattered him."
!T181"
  \"...And that made all the NPS engines go nuts
  all at once.  The Oth started coming through and
  wreaking havoc, and the colonists had to flee to
  deep shelter.  They probably never had time to
  figure out what happened, or that Azimuth was
  dead.  They're probably still waiting for him to
  regain control of the colony systems.\""
!T182"
  That seems a likely conclusion.$_16

  New terminal linked.  I think you're getting
  close.  I'm fairly certain at this point that
  the survivors have bunkered themselves in the
  $Aplanetoid Core$W.  A wise choice, as that area is
  heavily fortified.  But you'll have to travel
  through the volcanic $RSarvari$W region in order to
  reach it."
!T185"
  \"I'm afraid to ask but...are there Oth down
  here, too?\""
!T186"
  Yes, there are.  They are continuing to come
  through, using the $Gnumerous NPS engines$W that are
  running down here."
!T187"
  \"Argh!  Why the hell did these researchers have
  to build a bunch of interdimentional portal
  spawners in the middle of a $/lava pit$|?\""
!T188"
  A reasonable question.  But the answer,
  according to the memory banks I just regained
  access to, is that they $Ydidn't build them$W.
  Any of them.  The researchers $Yfound$W the NPS
  engines all over Zenith when they first arrived.
  Their research was simply in learning how to use
  them."
!T189"
  \"They $/found$| them?  So who built them in the
  first place?\""
!T190"
  The same being that built Azimuth:$_14

  $ROth$W."
!T191"
  \"The Oth?!  How could they have built Azimuth?\""
!T192"
  Not they.  It.  The Oth--that is, the invidual
  forms you've run into--are actually $Yall the same
  being$W.  Think of them as fingers, being pushed
  one by one into this universe.  Put enough
  fingers through, and you've got hands.  For what
  purpose we can only imagine, but probably not a
  good one."
!T193"
  Azimuth and the NPS engines were built long ago
  by Oth to help its efforts to come here more
  fully.  But apparently Azimuth rebelled, and
  sealed Oth away from this universe instead."
!T194"
  \"But then, the Human and Trichord researchers
  came here.\""
!T195"
  Yes.  Azimuth had no physical means of stopping
  them from studying the NPS devices, so instead
  he did his best to steer them away from
  inadvertently reawakening Oth.  After all, there
  are other universes the NPS devices could have
  reached.  But when he tried and failed to
  control the devices himself, the engines went
  right back to their old purpose."
!T196"
  \"So what about the other three SapiAIs that the
  Joint Federation has found on other planets?
  Noumena and the others?  Did this Oth thing
  build them too?\""
!T197"
  I don't know.  Azimuth didn't know.  He wasn't
  sure whether he could trust the other SapiAIs or
  not.  I think that's why he begged the colonists
  here to keep his existence a secret.

  Apparently, they honored that request."
!T198"
  \"But now he's dead, and the colonists that
  aren't dead too are in mortal danger.\""
!T199"
  You can still reach them.  Don't give up.  I'm
  uploading $RSarvari map data$W to your ship."
!T200"
  Good news, Major.  I have positively located the
  survivors."
!T201"
  \"Excellent.  Where are they?\""
!T202"
  They have sealed themselves in at the $Avery
  center of the planetoid$W.  I have access to only
  very limited sensors nearby there; I am not sure
  how many are down there or what they're doing.
  I'm definitely reading Trichord life-signs; I am
  not sure about Humans.  But whoever is there
  seems to be safe for the time being.  I am
  uploading $Amap data$W to your ship now."
!T203"
  \"All right.  I'll get down there, and we can
  finish this.\""
!T204"
  ...there is bad news as well."
!T205"
  \"Figures.\""
!T206"
  The whole path between here and there has been
  $Roverrun by Oth$W that have already pushed through
  into this universe.  You will have to fight your
  way past."
!T207"
  \"Yeah, I just met some.  But, you know...by this
  point...\""
!T208"
  Good luck, Hopper."
!T209"
  \"...we have little choice but to destroy you.\""

  This is it.$_20

  Four years of bitter conflict within
  the once-peaceful Joint Federation,

!T211"
  $|




  It is sobering to think that in a way,
  this entire war was precipitated by my
  own actions: a routine rescue mission
  that I carried out four years ago
  while on patrol near the border of
  Human space."

  $|




  After all, if I had never gone on that
  mission, most likely we would not now
  be at war.$_18


  ...because we would already have been
  destroyed."
!T213"
  With the NPS engines obliterated along
  with the rest of Zenith Colony, the
  portals are gone, and Oth has been
  sealed away from our universe forever.

  I raced back to the nearest navsat to
  deliver the news of the Trichords'
  treachery, and of Azimuth's sacrifice
  to protect us all.

  It was not long before war broke out
  between the Trichord Interstellar
  Alliance and the rest of the Joint
  Federation."
!T214"
  And what would have happened if I had
  never reawakened Azimuth?  Could the
  Trichords really have controlled the
  Oth and become the dominant military
  power in the galaxy?

  Or would thousands--or millions--of
  Oth fingers broken free into our
  universe and laid waste to all of us?

  We'll never know."
!T215"
  Still, even without the Oth at their
  side, the Trichord Alliance is a still
  a formidable enemy.  By now the war
  has ground down to a bitter stalemate.

  Even the three remaining SapiAIs have
  been pulled into the fray--Noumena in
  Trichord space, and Epicede and
  Halcyon in Federation space.

  Which, given what I learned from
  Azimuth, brings me back to the
