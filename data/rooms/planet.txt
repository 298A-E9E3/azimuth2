  Finally, an uplink!  Computer, what happened

  Query: Unknown.
  
  Status: Automated emergency disaster-control
  systems are active, although many of them have
  been badly damaged.
  
  No colonists are currently in the outer

!T7"
  Then where are they?  Are they still alive?"

  Of 284 registered colonists on Zenith, 47 human
  and 16 trichord fatalities have been reported in
  the past 48 hours."
!T9"
  Dammit!  ...But most of them are still alive?
  Where are they?"
!T10"
  ERR@@@##...unknown.  Earlier sensor reports
  suggest that they retreated deeper within the
  planetoid, into the Filimun region, following
  the unknown disaster.  The Filimun entryway is
  now sealed off with $Rblast doors$W from the inside.
  However, due to subsequent systems damage, all
  sensors and comms links from here to there are
  currently cut off."
!T11"
  I've got to get down there and help the
  survivors.  How can I get in?"
!T12"
  SeeeeCeCeCe&####...ERR/Restarting.  Checking
  sensors.  $RBlast doors$W are in place and cannot be
  unlocked from outside.  However, in an emergency
  situation, they could likely be breached with
  the $Rdefensive ordnance$W that is located in the
  upper armory."
!T13"
  Okay, sounds good.  How do I get to the upper
  armory from here?"
!T14"
  Routing...ERR%###SIGSEG.  Error.  Unable to
  access the colony's interior map data storage at
  this time, apparently due to the severe systems
  damage.  The armory is located nearby the outer
  habitation areas, beyond security doors whose
  location data I cannot currently access.  But I
  can unlock them remotely nonetheless."
!T15"
  Do it."

  Armory security doors have been unlocked."
