  Welcome, visitor, to Zenith Colony!            
  
  Query: Historical log patterns indicate that at
  any given time the majority of the colonists are
  located in the outer habitation areas.

!T38"
  \"No!  They're not there anymore, they've
  evacuated downwards!  Where are they now?  And

  Query: Zenith Colony is one of eight deep-space
  research efforts supported directly by the Joint
  Federation of Sentient Races, and of those it is
  the only institution run jointly between the
  United Human Planets and the Trichord
  Interstellar Alliance."
!T40"
  Recent research and development efforts at
  Zenith Colony have focused on studying
  Gravometric Waves, Nonlinear Paradimensional
  Shear, and Experimental Propulsion Technologies.
  Donations to support future research can be made
  by contacting the JSFR science liason office.

  they all go?\""
!T47"
  It seems that most of the colonists have
  relocated deeper down into the planetoid.  They
  may be waiting there for the central colony
  computer to restore emergency safety systems.
  However, all communication with that area is
  completely cut off at this time."
!T48"
  \"Aren't $/you$| the colony computer?  And what
  safety systems?\""
!T49"
  Logs indicate there were unexpected effects from
  the experiments into Nonlinear Paradimensional
  Shear in the past several days.  Uncontrolled
  NPS wormholes are likely responsible for the
  widespread systems damage."
!T50"
  According to records, the researches attributed
  this to operator error, and most recently, the
  central colony computer was put directly in
  charge of stabilizing the NPS catalysis devices,
  to prevent further indident."
!T51"
  \"So then what happened?  Why has everything gone
  haywire?\""
!T52"
  The NPS catalysis devices are currently running
  undriven.  The central colony computer is no
  longer functioning."

  \"What do you mean, the colony computer isn't
  functioning?  So what are you, then?\""

  trapped down there, waiting for these systems to
  be brought back under control, by the computer
  that they have no way of knowing isn't even

!T56"
  That is correct."
!T57"
  \"I need to reach them.  Fast.  But I keep
  running into blast doors I can't bust open.\""

  Query: The planetary transmitter array has been
  rendered non-functional due to severe damage to
  the ansibular rods.  Preliminary analysis
  indicates that the proximate cause of the damage
  was a high-pressure fuel line explosion just
  outside the antenna housing.  Prognosis: the
  entire ansible assembly requires replacement.

  Greetings Hopper.  Checking sensors...         
  
  $Xff8800[WARN]$W Most planetary sensors are cut off.
  There appear to be numerous damaged links
  throughout the data net.  Sensors available to
  this relay are limited to the upper portion of
  the Nandiar region.  No Humans or Trichords are
  currently present in that area."
!T72"
  \"Figures.  Any idea where I can find them?\""
!T73"
  It is possible that there may be researchers
  down in the Lower Nandiar Laboratory, but
  sensors for that section are not currently
  available."
!T74"
  \"Wait, there's another lab all the way down
  there?  Way underground?  What is it even for?\""
!T75"
  Politically, it serves the same purpose as the
  rest of Zenith Research Colony: to give the
  Humans and Trichords something to cooperate on,
  to help ease the tense relations between them.
  
  Scientifically, the Lower Nandiar Laboratory is
  where many of the high-energy NPS experiments
  are conducted."
!T76"
  \"Hmm.  All right, I'd better check it out, see
  if anyone's still in there.  Can you put it on
  my map?\""
