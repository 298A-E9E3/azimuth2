Azimuth is a metroidvania game, with vector graphics.  It is still a work in
progress.

Azimuth is inspired by such games as the Metroid series (particularly Super
Metroid and Metroid Fusion), SketchFighter 4000 Alpha, and Star Control II
(a.k.a. The Ur-Quan Masters) -- all fine games that are well worth your time.
